            "   - Multiple detailed nodes in the GT are aggregated into one node by the AI, and they are mapped together.\n"
            "3. Boundary/Layer Evaluation (Boundary Check):\n"
            "   - For successfully matched nodes, compare their \"boundary/package names.\"\n"
            "   - For all package names of the node, if there is a case where they are different from the successfully matched GT node's package name but semantically equivalent (e.g., GT is \"Backend::Data Layer::MySQL\", AI is \"Database::MySQL\"), it is judged as `true`.\n"
            "   - If a severe boundary-crossing error or context confusion occurs (e.g., a service belonging to the \"Order Context\" in the GT is placed in the \"User Context\" by the AI, or a backend component is placed in a frontend package), it is judged as `false`.\n"
