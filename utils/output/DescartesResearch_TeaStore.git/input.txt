# SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
The application is a micro-service reference and test platform designed for benchmarking and testing purposes. It simulates a web store that sells tea and tea supplies, featuring user interface elements for database generation and service resetting. The architecture consists of five distinct services plus a registry, allowing for unlimited replication and deployment across various devices. Communication between services is facilitated through REST and the Netflix Ribbon client-side load balancer. Additionally, pre-instrumented variants of the services utilize Kieker for detailed monitoring of the application's actions and behavior.
