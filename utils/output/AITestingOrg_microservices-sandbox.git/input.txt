# SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
This microservice application repository is designed to deploy the AIST Microservices Sandbox, which facilitates the development and testing of microservices. The main purpose is to provide a configurable environment for running microservices with integrated logging capabilities using Elasticsearch and Fluentd. Key technologies used include Docker for containerization, Kubernetes for orchestration, and EFK (Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana) for logging and monitoring.
