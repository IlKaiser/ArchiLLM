# SYSTEM DESCRIPTION: 

ChronoPic is a photo management platform where users can upload images and 
automatically tag them based on age detection and optionally known persons. The 
system provides asynchronous processing using computer vision (face & age 
detection), and supports secure user authentication. Users can view, filter, and 
manage their personal image collections based on metadata and detection results.
