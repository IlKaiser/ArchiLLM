# SYSTEM DESCRIPTION:
This microservice application is a demo designed to showcase a payment service within a larger ecosystem of microservices. It utilizes key technologies such as Kubernetes for orchestration, gRPC for inter-service communication, Istio for service mesh capabilities, and OpenCensus for tracing and monitoring. The application is instrumented for performance profiling, tracing, and debugging, and it integrates with tools like Prometheus and Grafana for metrics visualization, as well as Jaeger for distributed tracing.
